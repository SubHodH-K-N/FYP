        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Cancer is one of the most dangerous diseases which can be cured faster
          on early detection. This site helps you to know if a cell is cancerous
          or not by simply uploading the cell image. Since there are different
          forms of cancer for which the cell images vary a lot, we decided to
          work on the most common type of breast cancer which is Invasive Ductal
          Carcinoma(IDC).
        </p>
      </div>

        <h2>Confused what this website does?</h2>
        <p>
          We have made the web application simple and user friendly. The user
          needs to visit our website and upload an image of a cell. We will test
          if the given image is IDC +ve or IDC -ve with the percentage of
          accuracy.
        </p>

        <h2>What exactly is Invasive Ductal Carcinoma?</h2>
        <p>
          Invasive Ductal Carcinoma is cancer that begins growing in a milk duct
          and invades the fibrous or fatty tissue of the breast outside of the
          duct. IDC is the most common form of breast cancer, representing 80
          percent of all breast cancer diagnoses. Invasive means that the cancer
          has “invaded” or spread to the surrounding breast tissues. Ductal
          means that the cancer began in the milk ducts, which are the “pipes”
          that carry milk from the milk-producing lobules to the nipple.
          Carcinoma refers to any cancer that begins in the skin or other
          tissues that cover internal organs such as breast tissue.

        <h2>Want to know how exactly the application works?</h2>
        <p>
          For the outside eye it’s just uploading an image sample and waiting
          for the result. This is what happens on the backend. When the users
          upload the Whole Slide Image on their browser, it is given to our
          model which has been trained using Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN).
          We have taken datasets from kaggle to train our model. About two lakh
          fifty thousand image samples have been used as a dataset to train the
          model. The reason for taking such a huge dataset to train our model is
          to get the more accurate results.
